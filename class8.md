Code Review

ctrl button while hovering a function will give preview

Put function declaration at the top of code

then activities

- Keep functions sepreate
- leave little comments to yourself - to get bearing

- strategy and organization

- "Should" be as easy as going to strip logic and going down

- Loops - for (loop) and (while) loop

- For loop is is you know how many time you wan tto run the loop

- While loop - this is for when you do not know how many times you want to repeat the process

- Do while - this will do a loop even if the first reponse returns false

- key points to the loop:
 - for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
 -    document.write(i)
 - }

declare a variable (ver i) - ocasionally refered to as an idex in loops
assignment operator (i < 10) if I is less than 10 the loop should keep going
Increment operator (i++)

- Same operation
    - var i = 0;
    - i + 1 = 1
    - i + 1 = 2

    - var i = 0;
    - i++

- demonstrated For Loop - with above example


- Example - validate user passwaord (While loop - unless limited number of password attempts)
- added declaration to the top (
    - validateUserPassword();

- empty skeleton entered as below
    - function validateuserPassword() {
        - var storedpassWord = "pokemon";

        - var UserInput;
        - While (userInput !== storedPassword){

        }
        - var userInput = getUserPrompt("enter a password");
        }

        do {

            }while (userInput !== storedPassword);
}
