## Class Notes
- A lot of time you will be working with legacy code

- Lab, reading and review due tonight - higher level operators will start soon

- ensure to re-read the notes from the quizes!! This is where the test questions will be pulled from.

- Reading review - 

## Script
   - Like a recipe - I can read a recipe without smelling or feeling the end goal
   - We can 100% determine the outcome of a script by looking at the steps
   - flow charts are awesome!
   - as our script becomes more complex, so will our flow chart
   - syntax and vocabulary are important for a computer to understand what you are trying to get them to do

## Expressions
- 2 types
 - esperessions that jsut assign a value to a variable - - alertMessage = ("blah blah blah")
 - Espressions that use two or more values to return a single value - - math
 -
 ## Operators 
 - different types of operators
 - assignment operator
 - comparison operator - ()

## Functions
- Function - then give the name of the fuction - require open and closing () - these are key ways that js knows that you are using a function
- curly braces - hold code block within them - assigns the job of the fuction - executes when we call its fuction
- a parameter is the language we use when declaring of a function

## Parameter
- refers to the fuction definition or declaring a function

## Arguement
-Arguement refers to actual input at function call

## Code manipulation

-Create a meassage variable to be used as an argument for the promt() function

- console.log(response) - log would be a argumetn fo the console function

- fuction sayMessage(msg) { //msg is an parameter for sayMessage argument
-     alert(msg); //msg is an argumetn for alert fuction

- }

 - saymessage("hellow from the saymessage() fuction");


- ----

- var results
-   fuction add(a, b) {
-      var result = a + b;
-  }

- add(5, 2); // calling fuction above - assign the numbers in the parathesis are assigned to the variable (a , b)

 - var and let = let is more definitive - give more acces to a variable

- if everything breaks - look at inspect for console error

- var needs to be declared before fuction

---- - - - - - 
- second solution to fixing above issue--
-     var outsideResult = add(5, 2);

-      alert(outsideResult);

## get user promt

var  color

fuction setColorBasedonUserInput(rsp) {
if statemetn can be in here - using (rsp) as the variable

document.getElementbyID("content).sty
}
 setColorBasedOnUserInput(response);

 ## Readability
 - clear, readable code!
 - be consistant and thoughtful with spaces, and extra lines
