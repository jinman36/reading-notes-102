## What is git
- Version control system
- multiple developers can work on the same code 
  - essential part of saoftware development
- keeps history of changes to your files
  - View, apply, remove changes
- Keep all of your project files in one repository
- it makes collaboration possible

### without version control
- ensures that you don't loose history

### Snapshots in time
- commits represent each succesive version creates a new snapshot on the timeline of the project.
- a new commit creates a new version - retains previous (termpaper->termpaper2->etc)
- squashing will combine the A,B,C but is still a commit in time
- 

### Keeping track
- Each commit has a label that points to it
- HEAD = the label meaninig "You are here"
- You can also assign messages to commits
- messages are like writing a caption for your snapshot (What do you or a collegue want to know 6 months from now)

### Summary of Git
- You can use git to take snap shots of your code at points in time
- git keeps a history
- special lebel - HEAD - means you are here
- usually give a snapshot a label called a message
