## How Computers Work

### How do the hardware and software communicate?
- CPU - TH emaster chip that control all the other parts of the comp
- has smaller parts to break down its workflow
- circuits control math and logic
- circuits to manage sending and recieving
- manges different circuits to do each job
  - add command tells the cpu to add a file
  - save will tell a differnt set of circuits tp save
  - This is controled by binary code
No one writes code in binary
- Major programming languages
   - Python
   - Ruby
   - Blockly

These all let you code binary commands in an english "like" format

### Operating System
- Master program manages how the hardware operates the software on a computer
- the operating system controls loading and running of software
