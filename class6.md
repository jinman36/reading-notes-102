## How Computers Work

- has smaller parts to break down its workflow
- circuits control math and logic
- circuits to manage sending and recieving
- manges different circuits to do each job
  - add command tells the cpu to add a file
  - save will tell a differnt set of circuits tp save
  - This is controled by binary code
No one writes code in binary
- Major programming languages
   - Python

   - Blockly

These all let you code binary commands in an english "like" format
